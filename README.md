What is Full Stack Development?
Full stack development encompasses creating the front-end (what users interact with) as well as the back-end , which includes the server, database, and business logic. A full stack developer knows how to work with client-side technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as with server-side languages and frameworks like Node.js, Python, and PHP, including database integrations.

Front-end: HTML—mark-up, CSS—styling, JavaScript—client-side logic.
Back-end: Server application, REST APIs, authentication, business logic.
Database: Relational (MySQL/Postgres) or NoSQL (MongoDB) storage.
